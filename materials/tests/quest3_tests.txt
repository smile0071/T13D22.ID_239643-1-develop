# Manual tests for Quest 3 (encrypt .c and clear .h in src/ai_modules)
#
# Setup: create src/ai_modules with files:
#   m1.c   -> contains some ASCII text (e.g. "int main(){return 0;}\n")
#   m1.h   -> contains some header text
#   m2.c   -> contains "printf(\"Hello\\n\");\n"
#   m2.h   -> contains some header text
#
# Test 1: basic encryption with shift 1
Input:
3
1
-1

Expected behavior:
- All .c files in src/ai_modules are overwritten with Caesar-shifted content (printable ASCII 32..126 shifted by +1).
- All .h files are truncated to empty.
- Program prints only a newline after successful operation (no extra text).
- No changes outside src/ai_modules.

# Test 2: invalid directory (simulate by renaming src/ai_modules)
Input:
3
5
-1

Expected stdout:
n/a

# Test 3: early exit with -1 as shift
Input:
3
-1

Expected: program exits immediately (no output).

# Notes:
- For verification, inspect files in src/ai_modules after running.
- The cipher shifts only printable ASCII characters in the range 32..126 and wraps inside that range.
